This blog contains the unfiltered ramblings of a semi-retired autist on the internet. Nothing here constitutes financial advice, investment advice, trading advice, life advice, or advice of any kind. I am not your financial advisor, I am not anyone’s financial advisor, and if you’re taking cues from this site you may want to reassess several life choices.

All opinions expressed are my own, poorly thought through, subject to change without notice, and frequently wrong. Any trades, positions, or strategies mentioned are for entertainment purposes only and may result in catastrophic losses, emotional damage, and awkward conversations with loved ones.

Investing involves risk. You can lose some, all, or more than all of your money (congrats, you found leverage). Past performance is not indicative of future results. Duh.

Do your own research. Consult a licensed financial professional. Touch grass. If you lose money because you read something here and thought “yeah, this guy sounds smart,” that’s on you. Do not email me, do not sue me, and do not act surprised that you’re regarded.

By reading this blog, you acknowledge that you are responsible for your own actions, trades, and inevitable poor decisions.

Good luck. You’re going to need it.
